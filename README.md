## Notes on how to make the NN book using ICMLs

```cd``` to the NN working folder, by typing ```cd ``` and drag-n-drop the NN11 folder and pressing Enter. 

```make folders``` (only once) to create folder structure necessary for the project.

Once the md/somefile.md is there you can create the ICML files by running:
```make icmls``` if it ask for premissions, you have to add sudo to do the command: ```sudo make icmls``` and the .icml **files should appear insider the folder icml**

In **Github** interface go to Uncommitted Changes menu and:
* select the files you want to commit
* write a summary
* "Commit to Master"
* Sync
