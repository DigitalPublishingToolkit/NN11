    <Content>The Internet has been with us for scarcely more than thirty years and now it is on the verge of disappearing. Originating in the fifties with the first electronic communications between computers it became a political project during the sixties. The Internet’s technical bases were already established in the seventies and deployed during the eighties as part of military and scientific research. But it was only in the nineties, when the US authorized its commercial use that the Internet evolved into how we know it today. By this point the Internet had become firmly grounded on a few elementary principles that ensured its effectiveness and worldwide success. The Internet had to function on all networks, be able to withstand the failure of an important node and be as decentralized as possible. In just a few years it evolved into a complex assemblage of fixed and portable computers, cellular phones, connected objects, routers, data centers, cables, antennae and satellites – and of services and information. Today’s Internet represents the most vast and sophisticated communication system ever built.</Content>

Yet, little more than ten years ago, Skype, iTunes, Facebook, Google Maps, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, WikiLeaks, Dropbox, Spotify, Reddit and Instagram did not exist. Earlier developments such as Google, Paypal, BitTorrent, Wikipedia, Amazon, eBay, and public access to the Internet are still less than twenty years old. In the Internet’s early days bandwidth, contents and services were very limited, and the Internet was only accessible to a minority of people whose professional activities enabled them to make use of this new electronic tool. Nonetheless, the game-changing nature of the Internet for society had been widely predicted in the 1980s. Despite the many obstacles to the global spread of the Internet, numerous pioneers were deeply convinced that it would become a powerful medium for free expression and could revolutionize the sphere of individual freedom.</Content>

    <Content>A few elementary building blocks had already been placed in the renewal of one of society’s major foundations: the social bond. Indeed, the Internet has effectively transformed the practical terms of interaction. The spatial distance remains, but its nature has changed. We are witnessing a radical rearrangement of the relative place of the realities that constitute our world. Now, everything that can be dematerialized will be dematerialized, everything that can be connected will be connected. We are now confronted with the emergence of a network so technically universal that it is ‘naturally’ inclined to create one vast space, progressively covering the planet as a whole.</Content>

Freedom of speech was rarely so effective, offering unprecedented opportunities for communication. The ease of organizing small and responsive collectives spread over vast areas emphasized the Internet’s ability to mobilize expertise scattered around particular issues, i.e. online encyclopedias, software development, discussion forums, funding drives, political mobilization, etc. The near-zero cost of transmission and reproduction of information has disrupted the economy of intangible resources.

    <Content>The Internet is a powerful driver of innovation, fueled by its unique culture of openness. This openness is characterized by free access to the sources of its strategic tools and in the documentation of those components that are vital to its free usage. The Internet’s decentralized structure has resulted in the proliferation of diverse public initiatives and associative, private, individual and collective enterprises. Any intermediary wishing to impose itself at the expense of more efficient forms of mediation runs the risk of either being bypassed or discarded altogether. Twenty years after its commercial development, the Internet appears to be at the peak of its potential.

    <Content>But in recent years, the Internet’s founding principles have been challenged in many ways, and the diversity and power of these threats are likely to put an end to what now increasingly appeared as a utopia. Freedom of expression is now subject to surveillance and control on an unprecedented scale. Formerly a space of freedom, the Internet has developed into the world’s largest panopticon. The idealistic assumptions of a prospering collective intelligence have been shaken by the commercial exploitation of individual productions and their appropriation through increasingly sophisticated communication strategies. The ‘gift economy’ of the Internet is being challenged by the growing demands, not all illegitimate, of content producers. As the Internet’s potential no longer needs to be demonstrated, very powerful actors are attempting to take control of it, by replacing the open and publicly documented standards with closed and proprietary ones.</Content>

    <Content>In their desire to make the world a common space for all humanity, the early Internet pioneers underestimated both the fragility of societies and the strength of opposing forces. As societies hold diverse values certain parties are demanding that the Internet increasingly conforms to their own private interests. We now see this confrontation of public and private, individual and collective claims steadily growing and we have to come to terms with the fact that the Internet will change profoundly. The Internet was largely built on the basis of North American values; today it will have to adjust to a far larger and more complex reality.</Content>

    <Content>This is why we now witness both the globalization of politics and the ‘nationalization’ of the Internet happening simultaneously. Politics is a subtle art that involves sharing the world in a common way. Politics is supposed to organize a peaceful coexistence in order to render otherness acceptable. For this to occur politics requires the acceptance of different values within society and among societies. Space is precisely one of the dimensions of this otherness. In seeking to abolish space, the Internet runs the risk of being abolished by space itself, for the simple reason that space cannot be abolished. Individuals do indeed belong to multiple spaces, but politics is structured on the basis of territories that are the source of its legitimacy. The world as a whole may be an increasingly desirable political horizon for humanity, yet the world as such does not yet possess sufficient legitimacy to exercise governance over the Internet or to guide its growth and suitability for divergent interests. This is the reason why national reactions to the Internet’s universalism may well turn ugly unless its political issues and consequences are better understood.</Content>

    <Content>The Internet seeks to reduce the world to a ‘point’. Free flows, abolition of distance, or transparency, are just utopias, or dystopias if you prefer, while their actual implementation reveals their contradictions. The diversity of the world is at the core of politics. We must constantly negotiate a range of political values such as liberty and equality, individuals and society, privacy and transparency, free access and property. These values are precariously balanced between competing options and their stability is merely temporary. This is why the Internet should always be written with a capital ‘I’. In the midst of all this conflict, it is absolutely necessary to remember that there is one and only one Internet and that is has become so commonplace does not detract from its uniqueness. The Internet is not like a radio or furniture. The ‘Internet’ is a proper name, just like ‘Norway’ or ‘The European Union’. Whatever we do to alter the Internet, however locally, affects the Internet as a whole. Moreover, the end of the Internet would not mean the emergence of ‘micro internets’. Such a term would make no sense. There is a more sinister term to describe it: the ‘intranet’. The ‘intranet’ is a generic term and there are many intranets already. Countries like Iran, for instance, would gladly replace the unique global Internet with national intranets over which they have strict control.</Content>

    <Content>This is why it is so important to keep in mind that as our values change so will the Internet itself. Neglecting this dual dynamic obstructs clear thinking about the world and the future of the Internet. It prevents us from realizing that not only can the relative value of privacy or ownership change but the Internet itself continues to evolve, constantly readjusting to social, economic and political developments. The Internet is changing society and society is changing the Internet. Today it is essential that contemporary societies engage in a broad debate about what should be done in this renewed space and to establish the rules of coexistence that will make it possible to accommodate the numerous practices now emerging. A legitimate policy must arbitrate between the developing possibilities so as to make the Internet a legitimate space too. Failing this the Internet will be destroyed by conflicting claims. May this book help the Internet survive singular interests and contribute to it remaining a truly global space for humanity.</Content>

    <Content>The Internet presents a paradox that is difficult to understand and that has resulted in many misconceptions. The Internet is both abolishing space yet at the same time constituting a space itself. Common language betrays the close semantic proximity of the Internet and space: we speak of ‘going on the Internet, of a ‘navigator’ (the technical term for a browser), we ‘surf’ the Internet, where there are ‘sites’, ‘addresses’, firewalls and paywalls, and we talk about ‘virtual spaces’ in general. Immediately from its beginnings the Internet was considered in utopian terms. Coming after the invention of the telegraph and the telephone, the Internet meets the growing expectations of being able to make contact over increasingly remote distances. The Internet may be explainable purely in terms of its technical, economic or social components but first and foremost it remains a spatial innovation that attempts to limit the relevance of distance.</Content>

    <Content>It is essential to make a distinction between the societal origins of the Internet’s emergence and the consequences of its deployment on society. Overall, the causes can be attributed to the widespread aspirations to maximize social interaction whereas the consequences are the outcome of the realization of this aspiration. A near perfect analogy for this distinction is the automobile: a specific car is produced in response to a recognizable demand for individual mobility whereas the long-term consequences of the cars for society in general are much more complex.</Content>

    <Content>The cognitive dissonance that arises from this confusion of causality with long-term consequences has created an ideological shift in expectations about the Internet. This confusion is detrimental to a proper understanding of the real relationship between the Internet and its social environment. When the Internet developed, it was not only the abolition of space and distances that was suggested but also an implied opposition between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ life and ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ spaces. This opposition triggered many questions regarding the Internet’s unique spatiality. When ‘we go on the Internet’, where are we actually going? What does a site’s URL and ‘address’ mean in such a context? What is the nature of the virtuality of the Internet? Where is the Internet? These questions emphasize that in order to understand the Internet, a better understanding of space is essential.</Content>

    <Content>My hypothesis here is that the difficulty we encounter in understanding the influence of the Internet on today’s world largely stems from an erroneous conception of space. Space is usually considered as a material reality and is often equated to the territory on which other realities, such as individual people, resources, dwellings and vehicles, are located. This weakness in the conception of space, even though it is widely held, can easily be addressed by asking a relatively simple question: if space is a thing, where is that thing called space located? This question indicates the contradiction inherent to a conception of space as a material support for action. It also underlines the confusion surrounding this word ‘space’: between what locates and what is located. Space, however, is not material and neither is it a support. Certainly, a space can be located but always in relationship to another space.</Content>

    <Content>The consequences of what we could term ‘spatial materialism’ have been substantial. This materialist approach to space does not allow us to fully understand what constitutes the Internet’s reality. The opposition between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ life is certainly the most absurd outcome of this misunderstanding since it denies the reality of an increasing number of relations, situations and actions. Ultimately this confusion between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ obscures another even more insidious distinction, between the real and the material. To be more exact, it is the immateriality of the relations generated through the mediation of the Internet that lies at the heart of an enormous misunderstanding. This misunderstanding arises from thinking in terms of the traditional materialist conception of space. It is not enough to assert that data centers and cable networks form the reality of the Internet. The reality of the Internet is far more considerable in scope. It includes both the total quantity of data being circulated and all the practices taking place on the Internet. These immaterial mediations constitute real and effective interactions which feature prominently in contemporary life.</Content>

The advantage of this space is that it accommodates our bodies and is an important marker for organizing coexistence. But territory does not hold a monopoly on spatial interaction. Mobility-organizing networks create discontinuities and rearrange the relative loci of the realities that shape a territory. Roads and railways constitute preferential links between places with a kind of material stability – e.g. schools, hospitals, housing estates – which demands mobility to be organized according to what may be mobilized – such as bodies, food, books, building materials, etc.</Content>

    <Content>Today we must learn to understand the mechanisms operating between the material and the immaterial, between networks and territories, and between the Internet and the other spaces that preceded it. It is worthwhile to stress again that in itself the Internet does not abolish space anymore than it abolishes distance. The Internet merely diminishes the relevance of distance within certain configurations and in response to specific interactions. For this to occur, the Internet forms a new type of space, it creates new relationships between numerous material actualities, new places that morph into mediations and become increasingly crucial to an increasing number of practices. Wikipedia, Facebook and YouTube are all among the many specific spaces meeting particular demands with remarkable effectiveness. Such spaces are not inferior or ‘virtual’ but very real and actual spaces. The immaterial character of the activities taking place within them does not reduce their reality. On the contrary, this quality enhances their capacity to fully respond to specific needs. These spaces emerge precisely because they meet demands that other territorial spaces are not able cater to with the same degree of effectiveness.</Content>

    <Content>Matter is difficult to shift around because it is composed of energy and mass. Displacing matter demands an amount of energy exponentially proportional to its mass. But light and electricity, the primary carriers of information over the Internet, are composed of energy circulating in electromagnetic form. They are waves flowing, ideally at the speed of light. By channeling this energy into continuums we are able to establish these high-speed connections at a planetary scale. Thus we are witnessing the emergence of new spaces that restructure the relative loci of things. These spaces are not simple transpositions of already existing spaces like libraries, shops, kiosks, schools or cafes. They are particular spaces with their own specific characteristics. They are spaces that are making a remarkably efficient use of the properties of the immaterial. That is the reason why they allow extremely high transmission speeds over long distances.</Content>

    <Content>The limitations of the Internet are many. Unlike light, the speed of transmission of relevant information within the context of social practices can be slow. This happens for instance when a very high definition film is sent from one side of the world to the other: the transfer time can be longer than the film itself. Latency time may also be unsatisfactory. The delay, usually expressed in milliseconds, might prove too long for the synchronicity demanded by some videogames or by tele-surgery. The amount of information transmitted within a given timeframe, or bandwidth, and the basic connection time (ping or round-trip time) lie at the core of the digital divide.

    <Content>The Internet is not an answer to the numerous material challenges we encounter in our lives. Our bodies partake in a complex spatiality entailing concrete matter. Sensors measuring and monitoring our activities do of course enhance the interlinking of our bodies with an ever-greater number of technical devices. The digital may help us gain a more exact understanding of our practices and their evolution, through feedback that helps us make informed decisions and alter our habits. This is something that is captured in the term ‘the quantified self’. But the digital is limited to organizing information and this does not cover all the demands of our body. Our body requires food to nourish itself, clothing for warmth and medicines. Multi-sensorial interaction is also a need, whereas the Internet in its current state is confined to the two immaterial senses, sight and hearing, and cannot convey textures, tastes or smells.

    <Content>The Internet does not abolish space at all, but recomposes it and augments its potentialities and therefore as a consequence continually alters the value of ‘situated goods’ – i.e. goods whose worth is largely dependent on their locality – and of those resources whose materiality represents either a constraint or a resource.

    <Content>The ideal of digital ubiquity is faced with the challenge of established territories, which remain the basic spaces of our existence. These territorial spaces come together with the institutions organizing coexistence and possessing the legitimacy required to define which interactions are appropriate. Now the Internet attempts to impose a common space on top of this division of the world into separate territories organized according to different, and often contentious, social contracts. Therefore, when the quality of connectivity rises, space is not annulled, but on the contrary the disjunction between the Internet and the various territorial spaces organizing the world becomes greater in consequence.</Content>

    <Content>In this disjunction, the Internet becomes part of a complex type of spatiality articulating places and areas on different scales. Now the formerly accepted tenets of self-regulation and free circulation of information characteristic of the Internet are being questioned and challenged by societies reclaiming their sovereignty and demanding that the laws operating in their territories are obeyed. This disjunction between the plurality of political territories and the unicity of the Internet creates in itself a forceful dynamic that favors sharing. We are witnessing ever more sharing on the Internet based on common values. In concrete terms this means the merging of common ideals within the common space of the Internet. But at the same time we can see more sharing on the basis of specific values, in other words: a divergence of distinct ideals within distinct spaces.</Content>

Long-term typical features of the Internet such as freedom of expression, collective intelligence, costlessness, openness, decentralization and net neutrality constitute just as many challenges and provocations for political organizations that do not identify with these principles. Understanding the possible ends of the Internet requires a deeper appreciation of its original aims and purpose in the context of their incompatibility with the present day political order.</Content>

The Internet was meant to withstand major infrastructural disruptions in order to safeguard communication in situations of crisis.

    <Content>Social contracts, however, lie at the core of politics. Social contracts are about restraining some individual liberties in the name of the collective freedom deemed to be more fundamental and these contracts are backed by an authority that is appointed by the community for that specific purpose. Politics involve the method of allowing potentially opposing individual liberties to coexist. One of the inescapable limits to individual freedom has already been formulated in the French ‘Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen’ of 1789: ‘Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights.’</Content>

The basic units of regulation within this environment are numerous and sometimes at odds with each other on such fundamental issues as human rights, the rights of women, freedom of expression and intellectual property. How could the Internet ever decide for the world as a whole ‘what is appropriate’ without imposing the values of one particular society? How could it be possible to arrive at a common shared space without any regard for the particular social contracts individuals have obeyed? The Internet appears as a yet unheard-of space of liberty allowing individuals to remove themselves from a society they do not feel at home in.

Companies like Amesys, Blue Coat, Gamma International, Hacking Team or Trevicor were identified as major players in this ‘game’ of surveillance. A number of investigative journalists have stressed the risks such activities pose, not only for the people living under an authoritarian regime but also for citizens residing in the most democratic countries.

    <Content>Is it possible to reach a point of equilibrium between for example Iran’s stance of setting up a national intranet and the NSA’s plan to keep global communication under surveillance? In both cases the Internet is facing an obvious danger as well as a direct attack on its integrity. It is therefore urgent to engage in a political debate about the rules that should apply to the Internet space. This process has already begun largely through the recent disclosures about surveillance. But how can we organize such a debate? How can we prevent all parties concerned from retreating into their national borders? How can we avoid distrusting the major, international Internet companies when ultimately they are far more ‘national’ than they pretend to be? How can we conceive of the protection of privacy and security in a space where the rule of law cannot be strictly enforced? Since there is no worldwide consensus on which degree of freedom of expression is appropriate, instances of censorship are increasing and we are witnessing the eventual end of the Internet. This also applies to cases where the Internet is hijacked for undesirable purposes. Today, the confusion around freedom of expression is embodied in the names of Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. For some they are heroes of democracy and for others they are national traitors. Chelsea Manning, an American citizen, has been condemned to 35 years in jail by her own government, while Julian Assange and Edward Snowden have take refuge in the limbo of international law.</Content>

The distinction to be made between the US and China is not their technological means, which are essentially the same, but rather the ends motivating their surveillance practices.

    <Content>Contrary to John Perry Barlow’s aspirations, the Internet in itself does not possess the capacity to address and regulate illegitimate practices and conflicts of interest – just as the international political system is unable to self-regulate. Rather the opposite is the case: civil peace and the respect of human dignity is something that has been developed in most modern democracies through a complex process of regulation for the common good. It is precisely because freedom of expression is such an essential part of this regulation that it is itself being regulated. As valuable as freedom of expression may be, it does not in itself subsume all the necessary conditions of coexistence.</Content>

Nation-states are also unable to cope with the fact that their operating scale is no longer appropriate for the vexingly complex problems of the world today. Yet the globalization of the Internet does not in itself bring about the globalization of values, let alone that of politics. The Internet does facilitate the emergence of a political space at the scale of the planet but that space still has to be invented. By the time this has actually happened there is a real chance that the Internet will cease to exist.</Content>

    <Content>The reason why freedom of expression takes on such importance as an issue is because it lies at the very core of the collective organization of coexistence. Free speech is what enables us to question the existing order and is one of the pragmatic conditions for the exercise of democracy. It not only allows us to cast doubt on the prevalent ideas at a given time but also to challenge the actors involved in governance and the enforcement of rules and laws. Individual freedom of expression allows for an informed debate among citizens; without this basis it is impossible to arrive at our own critical opinion. But this consideration was overlooked for a long time and was restated only towards the end of the seventeenth century. The acknowledgement of the individual as a basic unit of collective intelligence appeared at that moment as the necessary condition for the emergence of a common, non-transcendental body of thought leading to the establishment of modern democracies. The difficulties encountered in assessing the potential of individually organized groups is probably due to the common confusion between the frailty of individual intelligence and the power of collective intelligence. To believe in the potential of individuals as a collective means exactly the opposite of believing in the potential of a sole individual; i.e. it means acknowledging individual fallibility while at the same time recognizing the power of insight residing in each one of us.</Content>

    <Content>Democracy is certainly one of the most powerful manifestations of the potential discussed above. Democracy literally constitutes a political choice for the organization of particular interests in the service of a common good. It encapsulates Abraham Lincoln’s famous dictum that democracy is ‘the government of the people, by the people, and for the people’. Such a statement presupposes first and foremost that individuals are those best placed to know what is good for them. It has by now become obvious that societies that choose to organize their government along these lines have witnessed economic growth far in excess of those that pursued a different route. The former type of societies have in particular fostered the emergence of the individual human being as the basic unit of the social contract and endowed her with a new degree of acceptance, freedom and protection. The intrinsic superiority of democracy over an oligarchic system, let alone a dictatorship, was nonetheless far from obvious in the beginning. It required the development of a complex architecture of representation and delegation. This is because democracies need an effective freedom of speech to function, but must also safeguard the autonomy of what is its ultimate affirmation: the ballot box.</Content>

    <Content>Misgivings about the democratic order of societies are bound to remain, but they mostly convey the difficulties of coordinating what is common with what is individual. Many have pointed out the shortcomings of democracies but many also share Winston Churchill’s view that ‘democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time’. The philosopher Karl Popper noted in his opposition to the many enemies of democracy, that even though democracies might choose to elect future tyrants they are still preferable to already established tyrannies.</Content>

Its inadequate representation, despite the large number of participants involved, leads to burgeoning conflicts of interests between those who profit individually from valuable modifications and those who take care of the overall quality of the contributions. This phenomenon, already commonplace in IT development, is even more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia. It has now become clear that the current troubles with Wikipedia are not about amateurism but are caused by creeping professionalization, where some users have both a personal interest and also possess the expertise to contribute to the encyclopedia’s content. This is particularly the case with businesses and media celebrities who are increasingly attempting to manipulate Wikipedia’s content in their favor and they do not hesitate to hire specialized firms in order to carry this out.</Content>

The Internet has now reached a dead-end of sorts as privacy can no longer be strictly regulated and anonymity increasingly appears to be both a source of liberty and of manipulation. This contradiction is handled by democracies by identifying individuals when they come to the polling station but in such a way that no link can be made with their vote. This basic principle is essential to coproduction processes as it vouches for the integrity of collective creation while verifying the legitimacy of the individual contribution. The limits to anonymity are becoming more evident by the day, whereas the Internet’s potential to allow for individual expression is usurped for the benefit of those who have the greatest mastery.</Content>

The fact that states are unable to enforce compliance with principles they deem fundamental or critical has become a major source of contention and by now presents a considerable risk to the very integrity of the Internet.

The mass practices typical of today’s Internet are due to the radical transformation of space it brings about which have substantially increased the potential for contact and interaction over remote distances, while at the same time considerably reducing their costs.

    <Content>Since every economic transaction is also a form of communication, it is not surprising that the economy is influenced by the expansion of the Internet.

    <Content>Visibility is a vital component of the economy since its absence would make a transaction impossible. It represents the initial condition for demand and supply to come together. Advertisement, recommendations and visual merchandising all contribute to visibility. The actual exchange constitutes the other component of a transaction. Once a level of visibility has been attained, finalizing the transaction demands a contact between demand and supply. Such contact is obvious in the case of a physical display, in a shop, but less so when the demand appears on ads or from a friend’s recommendation. The object of the future transaction needs to be communicated between the party desiring it and the one able to provide it.</Content>

    <Content>From classified ads to auctions, from flat swapping to accessing music, project funding to stock trading, the Internet has changed the economy in its most fundamental aspect: the practical modalities of exchange. This is especially the case where non-material resources are at stake, but it actually impacts on all things that may become an object of an economic transaction: e.g. the hospitality trade, financial institutions, publishing houses, etc. By enhancing visibility and simplifying transactions, the Internet has significant consequences for the economy as a whole. In this sense Amazon might well be the most striking example of the complex coupling of the material and the immaterial in the service of economic transactions.</Content>

    <Content> That free handouts, despite their efficacy, are not even more commonplace comes from the fact that they still represent a non-negligible risk to the merchant: i.e. not being able to recoup the cost of making the resource available for free. Therefore, the higher the price of the resource involved, the greater the risk. However the Internet has considerably reduced the risk of loss by lowering the costs of visibility, contact and production. ‘Free’ therefore can include many more trade practices, shrewdly profiting on its symbolic appeal. This is because a price tag, however small, immediately puts a clear restraint on the chance of an exchange occurring.</Content>

Considering the cost of communication and reproduction is essential in order to understand the parallel rise of a firm the size of Google, the legitimate circulation of journalist articles free of charge and the illegal pirating of music and film on a vast scale. The concept that all these ‘free’ resources, legitimate or not, share in common, is economy of scales pushed to its limits. This is already an overriding principle in the sphere of material production. The higher the quantity of goods produced, the less their unitary costs, as the marginal cost of every unit produced after the first one dwindles. In the case of production and editing music or film, economies of scale is very substantial but conversely, so is the costs of their materialization as books, CDs and DVDs in terms of production, storage, and distribution.</Content>

This is only possible because while the service may be free for users, it is certainly not for advertisers.

    <Content> Material goods, on the other hand, are ‘situated’, and therefore cannot be the object of multiple transactions. ‘Displacing’ means precisely the end of ‘placement’ at a specific space in favor of placement in another space. But transmission does not involve displacement. Intangible goods, once transmitted, still remain available to the original transmitter and other parties. This difference lies at the heart of the disruption of the traditional notion of ownership, as it was developed at a time where intangible goods were limited purely to ideas.</Content>

    <Content>The ambiguous nature of gratis is due to the way it can be both a vector of freedom and one of dispossession. When talking about ‘free’ it is always important that we ask who is paying and for what. The prevalence of gratis on the Internet covers many different realities and the only thing they have in common is the Internet’s potential to reduce the per-unit cost of transmission and reproduction to a negligible amount. But even when a resource is non-rivalrous and its marginal production cost zero, the initial cost of production still remains an unresolved issue. Furthermore, everything digital requires an array of hardware infrastructures that may involve substantial running costs.</Content>

Server hosting charges also involve substantial costs. For the financial year of 2012 Wikimedia’s expenses were almost 50 million US$. This was paid with funding through several foundations such as Stanton and Alfred P. Sloan, major IT corporations – Apple, Google, Microsoft – and an increasing volume of user donations. This particular form of gratis remains an exception on the Internet. Although its approach shares much in common with the ones practiced by many Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) initiatives, Wikipedia’s immense popularity demands far more financial resources.

    <Content>The Mozilla Foundation, the ‘mother’ of the Firefox web browser, is a good example of the weaknesses of this type of funding. Originally funded by AOL after Microsoft anti-trust convictions, the Foundation presently derives most of its funding from Google, which wanted its search engine to be the default on Firefox. But Google, tired of paying Microsoft for Internet Explorer, Apple for Safari, or the Mozilla Foundation for Firefox, launched its own browser, Chrome. Now Mozilla not only directly competes with all the major IT corporations but also with its primary funder. Firefox’s market share is already dwindling and it will be increasingly difficult for it to continue competing with transparency, open access to the source code and respect for the privacy of user data as unique selling points. The deep pockets of Google and Microsoft in the battle for dominance over one of the key components of digital practices means that Mozilla, despite its remarkable initiatives and superior quality will probably become the next big casualty in the brave new world of free.</Content>

    <Content>The preference for crowdsourcing by Google, Wikipedia, Twitter and Facebook does not embody all possible production formats. In fact, the confusion between mediation and production is such that many such sites actually consist of illegally obtained content. In this case the transmission, while nearly costs-free, comes with a fee, whereas the production costs are not covered at all. The least important consideration in these transactions is the actual value of the property changing hands. This should not detract from the fact that gratis is still a crucial factor for spreading the idea of free use. It also encourages a spatial fluidity whose value is still not fully understood. Unfortunately this fluidity translates into a concentration of power in the hands of a small number of firms that are now becoming mere intermediaries. As intermediaries these firms derive all of their profit from content they do not produce themselves. This is the reason why gratis threatens those creations, which cannot be accommodated in this mediation-based business model.</Content>

    <Content>This is particularly true in the case of investigative journalism and the creation of audiovisual content. Investigative journalism is a long-term project requiring a high level of expertise and sometimes involves gaining specific rights. Producing a film requires an investment that can cost millions of Euros. Recording a music album also demands a lot of time. A society that does not appreciate the costs of production runs the risk of creating a crisis in the creative industries where only those who are financially independent or able to derive adequate revenues from ads are successful. This is a possible option of course but one that will impoverish the diversity and the quality of creative work for the benefit of intermediaries who are not particularly concerned with the actual content. Since those who want to produce without expecting remuneration are already free to do so, why should we impose this model on all creative workers?</Content>

This is how potential decentralization reconfigures into functional centralization; largely for the benefit of those actors who are able to take advantage of these new forms of centralities. Occupying a central place is a major asset, since such a key position can only be challenged by severe disruptions of existing technologies and practices.</Content>

    <Content>One of the simplest methods to achieve centrality was used in the beginning of the 1990s by many access providers. This was at the dawn of commerce on the Internet and AOL, Wanadoo and many other companies used their homepage to promote their own services, often against the best interest of their customers. Yahoo, for instance, built its centrality on its homepage far before the rise of Google. Microsoft acted more insidiously, by bundling its own ‘Internet Explorer’ with the Windows operating system, at the expense of the Netscape web-navigator, its superior competitor at the time. Even Google has resorted to such methods, despite its effectiveness, by offering large sums of money to become the default search engine on Firefox and Safari.</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>The most powerful element to achieving centrality comes from the network effect. Through default choice, status quo and gratis, the number of users expand and often to a high enough level to substantially enhance usage value. This is why the common criticism that we cannot have more than a 120 meaningful friendships on Facebook confuses several distinct issues and ultimately prevents us from understanding what is really at stake. On the one hand Facebook is a social media platform that supports a large number of relationships of a diverse nature, not all of which are close or everyday. Facebook is a good example of so-called ‘weak links’. Its features make it possible to maintain relationships at a distance but which would be wearisome to keep active through other mediums such as telephone, mail or face-to-face. On the other hand a critique of social media based on the work by the British anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar, suggests that the highest number of relationships a human being can maintain is somewhere around 150. This theory is based on a comparative analysis of the relative size of the neocortex and is corroborated by the remarkably consistent average group size of 148.4 individuals in modern hunter-gather societies.</Content>

If this were the case how can we explain Facebook’s success and the growth of modern cities? In both cases, the appeal of the urban environment or of the most frequented social media space is based on the opportunities they offer the individual to find what they desire even if not all possible opportunities will ever be realized. What is important is the potentiality of relationships, the fact that they may occur. This is why the network effect is so crucial to any service operating on the Internet.

    <Content>Understanding the rationale of hypercentrality demands a good grasp of the particular properties of networked spaces. The concentration of more and more digital practices in a growing number of spaces cannot simply be translated into a notion of territorial places. Territorial places are based on proximity whereas networked places are based on relatedness in terms of content.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>The multiplicity of territorial places is unavoidable because matter takes up space and its relocation takes time. This is why we have seen a proliferation of similar places, responding to a number of very basic spatial needs, like the need to stay dry, to pass on knowledge, to seek medical care, etc. Therefore, a flat, a primary school or a local shop cannot be ‘globalized’, not only because they have a limited capacity but also because the distance in relation to other spaces would become too great. The reason why territorial places can be in excess of what is required despite their distinctiveness is because territorial distance still remains relevant in many circumstances. It becomes crucial when the body is a key element in the interaction. Economies of scale are not an exclusive preserve of the Internet and hence monopolies may also emerge in the case of territory-based activities but the process will take much more time. Such monopolies will face local constraints that are more difficult to handle and territorial domination is also more complex and costly.</Content>

    <Content>The Internet is composed of networked places whose spatiality is based on the movement of intangible items. The near instant connectivity of the Internet gives it an edge which when optimized may have distinct consequences. That any given place on the Internet may be reached by a single mouse-click does no result in a plurality of spaces, but on the contrary, it gives a strong advantage to the most efficient spaces. This is exactly what hypercentrality is about. It represents a centrality endowed with so much power that it has the potential to force itself upon space in general, absorbing the periphery into one single point of total, boundless intensity.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>What makes hypercentrality such a noteworthy factor is that it intensifies the features of centrality to an extreme degree. Once hypercentrality has been achieved in one domain, the visibility gained makes it much easier to buy out the remaining local sites. InterActiveCorp, the owners of the Match.com dating site and the ads site eBay, did exactly that in order to enhance their centrality in those cultural spaces where other sites had already attained a considerable centrality. Hypercentrality then makes it possible to start new services by benefiting from a phenomenon best described as networked consolidation. This is why we witness a growing diversity in the more central spaces that aim to broaden their activities to other services in order to achieve the same degree of centrality with this new service.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Thus hypercentrality has a tendency to reduce the number of spaces devoted to a particular issue and the dynamics of networked consolidation make these few remaining spaces vie with each other for total centrality. Yet, network effects are sometimes so powerful that even the holders of longstanding, sweeping centralities still cannot overcome them. This is the case with Facebook, whose hypercentrality appears to be entirely immune to attacks by its competitors. Facebook’s domination becomes exasperating when we hear its founder Mark Zuckerberg claim that his expansionist policies are justified due to fact that the service he provides is analogous to a public electricity supplier. But electricity is a physical good and its production and distribution involves a large range of private companies. We would never want to depend on a single monopolistic corporation to provide all our electricity.</Content>

    <Content>Google was not able to develop its own large-scale social network despite its remarkable degree of hypercentrality. The usual strategy of buying up spaces with an established strong centrality is more of a struggle as such spaces are already overvalued in most cases. Yet more corporate actors are tempted to take advantage of their prominent position in order to buy out potential competitors or to offer additional services. This allows them to take full advantages of economies of scale, network effects and hypercentrality, and ultimately to extend their domination. Recent examples are when Facebook bought out Instagram whose growing success was perceived as a threat and eBay’s acquisition of Paypal, with the aim of taking greater control over their users’ monetary transactions.</Content>

Google has managed to extend its activities to nearly all the services available on the Internet: from email, videoconferencing and web browsers to DNS servers, mobile phones and translation. Google’s expansion into operating systems and web browsers must be seen as an active strategy of total Internet domination. If we understand the Internet as a space, it is easy to also understand why Google offers both an operating system and a web browser for free. Both systems are core components of Google’s ‘mastering Internet space’ strategy. All online activities are dependent on these two software packages, giving Google a massive lead on today’s Internet life. Google’s position not only allows it to constantly improve its services but also to continually valorize them, making its hypercentrality potentially limitless.

The moment that Facebook has the power to decide that showing a beheaded women is less shocking than nudity, some serious questions arise.

    <Content>The full-scale development of surveillance techniques took place in successive steps, each stage demanding a further step in the interconnectivity of networks. Since 9/11 the legal framework regulating the power of surveillance in terms of scope, retrieval and data use has been greatly enhanced with the US taking the lead. Article 215 of the Patriot Act is typical in this respect as it authorizes the seizure of any ‘tangible’ personal material, even without the need for the individuals concerned to be suspected of terrorism. This article was further amended to permit digital data collection without warrant. In 2008, article 708 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) made this act applicable for all form of foreign intelligence gathering.</Content>

    <Content>The vulnerability of the Net now also means the vulnerability of the individual. Debates about striking a balance between security and privacy have become largely distorted, since privacy is itself an element of security. Privacy is a fundamental value within democratic societies because it underwrites the free exercise of individual activities which have their ultimate expression in the vote. This is the reason why totalitarian regimes actively suppress privacy. Though every social contract implies some relinquishment of privacy for the sake of the common good, the terms of such a contract must be thoroughly negotiated. In our present circumstances, it absolutely needs to be renegotiated in view of the evolution of the means and methods of surveillance.</Content>

Regrettably, we must come to the conclusion that these ideals are rapidly fading away. Seemingly abolished barriers are being re-erected again. Freedom of speech is subject to a number of restrictions. Connectivity and bandwidth are still unequally distributed. Power has never been so centralized.

Such practices openly contravene the principle of ‘net neutrality’, a concept that emerged in 2003, when some access providers were exploiting their strategic advantage to increase profits at the expense of their clients. These practices introduced an aspect of discrimination to the flow of Internet traffic, depending on location or the basis of content.

We are gradually becoming aware that the asymmetry between today’s digital practices and our current regulative apparatus is unsustainable. The extension of Internet usage to other major parts of the world is a great political challenge. At this stage, the many values that play a role in regulating societies are actuated: conflicts between individuals, states and businesses demonstrate that while freedom of expression, privacy and property may be fundamental principles, they are open to very different interpretations. The problems arising from the changes produced by the Internet revitalizes the contradictions between these values. It should be self-evident that security and privacy, intellectual property rights and gratis, freedom of expression and defamation laws are in opposition to each other. Generally speaking net neutrality is not a sufficient policy. Today it should be more apparent that the enduring existence of social values is not arbitrary and that they are often relevant and essential.

    <Content>What the world really needs is a major political debate centering on the future of the only space that the whole of humanity shares in common. There is no doubt that a choice will have to be made, between a globalization of politics or the end of the Internet as we know it. We will have to make the Internet the central issue of a debate which given the environmental crisis, the threat of global terrorism and the state of the world economy, obliges us to realize that what unites us is more important than what divides us. In the absence of such a radical shift in politics, we will not only witness a much more drastic partitioning of the Internet but even more worrying, a further fragmentation of our world. We will risk the collapse of globalization and nationalist insurgencies everywhere, which will render nation-states more powerless and vulnerable.</Content>

    <Content>The Internet is in clear danger of disappearing and part of our very humanity threatens to disappear with it. As the bearer of a form of globalization actively empowering individuals, the very existence of the Internet suggests that the time has come for humanity to consider a change in scale towards its final destiny: the world. The Internet is the perfect public place to rise to this challenge; it is an ideal but also fragile space that we must never cease to cherish, share and protect together.</Content>
